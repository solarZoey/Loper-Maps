## Summary of Activities This Week 

- Created GitHub repository to store all of our work and facilitate collaboration. 
- Created a GitHub project to keep track of all our current tasks and progress. 
- Decided on React Native for front end technology, Python and JavaScript for back end. 

## Progress Made 

During this past week, we spent most of our time creating a work environment for our project in GitHub as well as determining the most optimal method for creating a map of UNK’s campus to use for our pathfinding algorithm. We also created a spreadsheet for the longitude and latitude coordinates for each building on campus which will be used in our A* algorithm. One of our members has reached out to UNK’s IT department to procure floor plans for each building so that we can have a reference point when developing our application

## Challenges or Issues Encountered 

One potential challenge that we discussed this week was the security of our application, since users will be able to have full access to each building and be able to find where specific rooms are. We believe that this could serve as an issue that could be abused by unwanted visitors on campus. We are addressing this by contacting various members of UNK faculty. 

## Plans for Next Week 

- Get in touch with relevant members of staff to ensure we won’t be breaking any rules. 
- Create rough diagrams and/or flow charts to plan how we want our app to eventually function. 
- Practice with React Native app creation.
